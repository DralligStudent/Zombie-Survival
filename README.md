# Zombie-Survival
A prototype for testing AI implementations, I personally implemented the zombie decision making scripts. I used Unitys Scriptable objects to create a finite state machine for the zombie AI.

This is a prototype of a top down twin stick shooter, with zombies chasing the player as they aim to survive. The extended vision for the prototype is to allow the player to build defences out of items found within a semi procedural landscape, with every game being fuelled by a learning zombie AI that improves over the course of the game, with new characteristics that will alter the gameplay in each round. While only the very bare mechanics are implemented as of now, this idea would be a fun one to explore more with time.
